Zunpeng Liu is a Research Scientist at [MIT Computational Biology Lab] (https://compbio.mit.edu/) (PI: Professor [Manolis Kellis] (https://web.mit.edu/manoli/))

Research Areas
======
Aging, Aging-related diseases, Brain disorders, Neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, Computational biology, Regulatory network, Artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare/medicine, Precision medicine, etc.

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in epigenetic, regulatory networks for development, aging, and diseases. I mainly focused on understanding the epigenetic mechanisms and regulatory circuits for human development, aging, and brain disorders and identifying novel biomarkers and intervention strategies for human aging and aging-related diseases.
1. Epigenomic Regulation of Development, Cell Fate Determination, Lineage Specification, and Aging
2. Regulatory Network of Human Brain Aging, Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Diseases
3. Epigenetic Stability and Cell Identity Maintenance
4. “Junk” DNA/ Transposable Element/ Endogenous Virus in Aging and Diseases
5. Mechanism of Rejuvenation and Developing Novel Rejuvenation Strategies for Aging
